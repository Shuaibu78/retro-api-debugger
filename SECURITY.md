## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security bugs seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings, and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

### How to Report a Security Vulnerability

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them via one of the following methods:

1. **Email**: Send details to [security@yourdomain.com](mailto:security@yourdomain.com)
2. **GitHub Security Advisories**: Use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting feature
3. **Direct Message**: Contact maintainers directly through GitHub

### What to Include

When reporting a vulnerability, please include:

- **Description**: A clear description of the vulnerability
- **Steps to Reproduce**: Detailed steps to reproduce the issue
- **Impact**: Potential impact of the vulnerability
- **Environment**: Browser, OS, and version information
- **Proof of Concept**: If possible, include a minimal proof of concept
- **Suggested Fix**: If you have ideas for how to fix the issue

### What to Expect

- **Acknowledgment**: We will acknowledge receipt of your report within 48 hours
- **Initial Assessment**: We will provide an initial assessment within 5 business days
- **Regular Updates**: We will keep you informed of our progress
- **Resolution**: We will work to resolve the issue as quickly as possible
- **Credit**: We will credit you in our security advisories (unless you prefer to remain anonymous)

### Response Timeline

- **Critical vulnerabilities**: 24-48 hours
- **High severity**: 3-5 business days
- **Medium severity**: 1-2 weeks
- **Low severity**: 2-4 weeks

## Security Considerations

### API Proxy Security

The Retro API Debugger includes a proxy endpoint (`/api/proxy`) that forwards requests to external APIs. Please be aware of the following security considerations:

- **CORS Bypass**: The proxy allows requests to any URL, which could be used to bypass CORS restrictions
- **Rate Limiting**: No built-in rate limiting is implemented
- **Authentication**: No authentication is required to use the proxy
- **Logging**: Request details may be logged on the server

### Recommendations for Production Use

If you plan to use this tool in a production environment:

1. **Implement Authentication**: Add authentication to restrict access
2. **Add Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse
3. **URL Whitelisting**: Restrict which URLs can be accessed through the proxy
4. **Input Validation**: Add additional input validation
5. **Monitoring**: Implement logging and monitoring
6. **HTTPS Only**: Ensure all communications use HTTPS

### Data Privacy

- **Local Storage**: The application uses browser localStorage to persist request history
- **No Server Storage**: Request data is not stored on our servers
- **Client-Side Only**: All processing happens in the browser

## Security Best Practices

### For Users

- **HTTPS Only**: Only use the tool over HTTPS connections
- **Sensitive Data**: Avoid sending sensitive data through the tool
- **API Keys**: Be cautious when testing APIs that require authentication
- **Network Security**: Use the tool only on trusted networks

### For Developers

- **Dependencies**: Keep all dependencies up to date
- **Input Validation**: Validate all user inputs
- **Error Handling**: Implement proper error handling
- **Logging**: Log security-relevant events
- **Testing**: Include security testing in your development process

## Security Updates

Security updates will be released as soon as possible after a vulnerability is confirmed and fixed. We will:

1. **Create a Security Advisory**: Publish a GitHub Security Advisory
2. **Release a Patch**: Create a new patch version with the fix
3. **Update Documentation**: Update relevant documentation
4. **Notify Users**: Notify users through appropriate channels

## Contact

For security-related questions or concerns, please contact:

- **Email**: [security@yourdomain.com](mailto:security@yourdomain.com)
- **GitHub**: Use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting
- **Maintainers**: Contact project maintainers directly
